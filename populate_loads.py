#
# process for using this file:
# - copy data into a csv file
# - first row in csv file is assumed to be headers; data starts in second row
# - make sure course numbers follow "L" convention for labs (BIO 101L for the lab, etc.)
# - easiest to go in ahead of time and assign loads for labs by hand, rather than leaving them as "zeros"
# - need to create a "load" column in column "Q"...the column beside credit hours.  Can just copy the credit column
# - if there are any shared (co-taught) courses, make sure that exactly one section appears in csv file; shared courses need to be put in by hand later
# - instructors will be created if they do not already exist in the db
# - subjects and buildings need to be created ahead of time
# - rooms will be created if they do not already exist in the db
# - make sure room numbers use the same abbreviations as the db is using for them ('ESC' for Euler, 'NS' for Nussbaum, etc.)
# - blank entries for the BUILDING or ROOM in the csv file are replaced by 'TBD'
# - accepts begin and end times in either the '0950' or '950' format; in the latter case, it prepends '0'
# - to run this file, type python populate_loads.py

# to make it simple, just check if there are any course offerings that
# currently have no instructor and no weekly schedule; if so, assign it.
# it's not a perfect system, but it's not worth it to get too complicated....

# Here is a typical sequence of commands to create a course and schedule the profs, etc.:
#
# ./manage.py create_instructor Hank Voss 'Taylor University' MAT 0001 Full
# ./manage.py create_room ESC 241 24
# 
#
#................... need to go into the csv file and change ESC back to EULER.................................
#
#
#
#
#
# ./manage.py create_course PHY 124 'clarinet for physicists' 2 Spring E
# ./manage.py create_course_offerings PHY 124 J-Term 2014 [3,2,1] 32
#   Note: - makes sure there are a total of 3 offerings in J-Term of the 2013-14 academic year
#           - if some sections exist already, creates new ones as needed
#         - 3, 2 and 1 load hours, 32 students max enrollment
# ./manage.py add_instructor_schedule PHY 124 J-Term 2014 Hank Voss MWF 0900 1250 ESC 125
#   Note: - looks for "open" course sections (no prof yet, no daily meetings yet), then adds the above schedule to them
#         - in the above example, we would be looking at J-Term of the 2013-14 academic year
